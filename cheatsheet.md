How to modify SVG path parameters:

For the blue and orange waves:
Q0,125 60,250 — Control point and end point for the blue wave’s curve (change 0,125 and 60,250)
Q0,875 60,750 — Control point and end point for the orange wave’s curve (change 0,875 and 60,750)
The 60 values are the horizontal center; change to move the wave left/right.
The 125, 250, 750, 875 values are vertical positions; change to move the wave up/down or adjust the curve.
Summary:

Change the numbers after M, Q, and T in the d attribute to adjust the wave’s position and shape.
The first number is X (horizontal), the second is Y (vertical).
If you want a specific effect, tell me what you want to move (up, down, left, right, more/less curve) and I’ll give you the exact parameters!
